# pythonTurtlesPongGame
This is a python project that I created for a pong game. 
It consists of 2 human players hitting the ball across the screen.

The bats are represented by the 2 green objects and the ball is represented by the red circle. 
The player on the left uses W and S keys to move up and down, whereas the player on the right uses the up and down keys. 
Each time the ball is hit, it moves faster. 
When the player fails to hit the ball and lets it touch the edge, the opponent scores a point. 
When one player's score reaches 5, the game is over and that player wins the game. 

This code was written using object oriented programming, classes were created for each object to define their positions, how they look like and how they can move.
